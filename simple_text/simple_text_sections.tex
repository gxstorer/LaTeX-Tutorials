\section{Introduction}

        This is a demonstration of having sections and subsections within a document. To produce more content, I will include paragraphs from blindtext, which I discovered is not Shakespeare, but actually Cicero, which makes more sense since Shakespeare didn't speak Latin.

\subsection{Research Design}\label{section:Research Design}

        \blindtext

\section{Results}

        \blindtext[2] As noted in Section \ref{section:Research Design}

\subsection{Controls}

        \blindtext

\subsubsection{Appendix}
